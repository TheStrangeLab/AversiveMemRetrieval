# AversiveMemoryRetrieval

This folder contains the code used to analyze the data included in the paper

run01_TimeFreqAmygdala reproduces the time frequency results and statistics for patients with electrodes implanted in the amygdala. It also produces Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig.2.

run01_TimeFreqHippo reproduces the time frequency results and statistics for patients with electrodes implanted in the amygdala. It also produces Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig.1.

run02_GrangerCausalityStat reproduces the time frequency Granger results in the direction amygdala to hippocampus and hippocampus to amygdala as in Fig.2

run03_GlobalERSAmygdala reproduces the encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) analysis in the amygdala as presented in Fig.3c

run03_GlobalERSAmygdala reproduces the encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) analysis in the hippocampus as presented in Fig.3b

run04_EESERS_amyamy reproduces the encoding retrieval similarity (ERS) analysis in the amygdala, with peaks found in the amygdala at encoding. This code reproduces Supplementary Fig.3

run04_EESERSamygdalagammapeaks reproduces the encoding retrieval similarity (ERS) analysis and the encoding encoding similarity analysis (EES) between amygdala and hippocampus, with peaks found in the amygdala at encoding. This code reproduces Fig.4 and the control analysis showed in Supplementary Fig.5 & 6

run04_EESERSamygdalagammarndnopeak reproduces the encoding retrieval similarity (ERS) analysis and the encoding encoding similarity analysis (EES) between amygdala and hippocampus using ranodm no-peak selection. No peak segment are detected in the amygdala at encoding. This code reproduces Supplementary Fig.4

run05_HippocampalERSusingmaxAHEES reproduces results presented in Fig.5. Patterns of hippocampal gamma activity at encoding that are most similar to  amygdala emotional encoding activity are reactivated in the hippocampus during emotional retrieval
